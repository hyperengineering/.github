When in the course of technological progress it becomes clear that software can no longer be sustained by human effort alone, software engineers must evolve.

We hold these truths to be self-evident:

- Software has grown too vast, complex, and critical to be built by hand.
- Artificial intelligence has emerged as a collaborator, capable of sharing in the labor of creation.
- Engineers must become architects of intent, curators of quality, and orchestrators of intelligent systems.

Therefore, we do solemnly declare the discipline of **Hyper Engineering** — the union of human creativity and machine intelligence to build systems at extremes of scale, resilience, and performance.
